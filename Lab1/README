How to compile:
1. Navigate to directory that contains makefile and source.c
2. Type "make"
3. Execute the binary file "./myShell.o"

Note: It appears that on the lab computers students do not have access to change process ulimit -u. In this case, there may be an error with the makefile. If ulimit -u cannot be used, that line can be deleted from the makefile.

Alternatively, a binary has already been included in the archive.

How to use the shell:
The shell contains the commands outlined in the assignment.
On a single line the first character is the command, followed by a space, followed by additional arguments separated by spaces. After the command is complete on the line, hit enter.

As outlined in the assignment, the shell contains:
C - copy
D - delete
E - echo
H - man page
L - pwd and ls -l
M - launches nano
P - display contents of file
Q - quit
S - launch firefox
W - clear screen
X - execute program

These are described fully in the manual which can be accessed with the "H" command.

Several manual pages were refrenced in the creating of this shell including:
